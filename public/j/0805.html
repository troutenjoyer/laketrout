            feeling very overwhelmed lately. i'm starting a partial hospitalization treatment in a week and i've been charging through website updates as a coping mechanism for how scared i am. it's funny, part of what i explained about going into treatment was how much i struggled with doing things i enjoy. and i still am. except coding and website design.<br>
            i'm really really scared of being too vulnerable online. i like behind the scenes coding because i dont have to talk to anybody or process my thoughts or feelings or the things in my head. this journal entry is very a la exposure therapy, reminding myself that a degree of vulnerability is important to allow people to be close to you. i want to have people close to me.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>things i am going to work on in treatment, whether i like it or not</strong>
        <ul class="pixelbullets">
            <li>addressing my trauma and how it continues to impact my behavior</li>
            <li>get on a med regimen that, while not entirely sedating, helps me function on a daily basis</li>
            <li>advocating for myself inside and outside of treatment- what i need, what i want, and compromise that doesnt completely devalue myself.</li>
            <li>understanding how to ask for reassurance from psychotic thoughts/beliefs/visions without fear of judgement, and identifying people i can safely do this with</li>
            <li>restore bonds with current friends and work on feeling safe and secure in my relationships</li>
            <li>find self soothing techniques and restore my relationship to previous self soothing techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <strong>creative pursuits i am going to return to</strong>
        <ul class="pixelbullets">
            <li>drag/performance, digital and irl</li>
            <li>sewing</li>
            <li>comics</li>
            <li>collages</li>
            <li>writing</li>
            <li>music</li>
        </ul>   
        </p>
        <p>
            accountability works! now i've bullied myself into putting my treatment goals into the silly little website i find myself stuck on constantly. please do not expect regular updates on treatment, i have no interest in doing that! i want to keep my privacy and safety with regards to this process, i just needed to get something in code because this is where i've been spending all my time as i prepare.<br>
            i am optimistic for how this process will improve my life. i can tell my wife if i feel unsafe in the program. we also have a really good doctors appointment lined up... im manifesting. im thinking. im listening and learning and processing. thank u for listening meow.<br>
            i hope to update my art pages more, and continue building out this website, it's very fun. i want to do other things too... i'm seeing big freedia this month at the party of all time! (boots) (i need to make my boots page)
