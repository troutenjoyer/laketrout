        <p>this was my first birthday with my wife! what an exciting time! she gave me a really really lovely birthday, perhaps the best one of my life. i wanted to talk about some of the lovely things that happened!</p>
        <p><i>the night before...</i></p>
        <p>we went to my favorite drag show in the city!! we don't leave our houses a lot so this was really exciting haha ... we got to see so many of our friends and dress really cute <br>
        idk i am always so excited when i get to put on makeup and wear my cat ears to the club but i also have to have such a good reason to do it or i wont. birthday... very good reason.
        </p>
        <p><i>lunch</i></p>
        <p>i watch a lot of travel food videos... and there's a buffet in our state i've always wanted to go to <img src="/emotes/sweat.gif"> and we finally went!! we had such delicious seafood plates heheh...<br>
        <div class="image"><img src="/j/birthday/lunch1.jpg"> <img src="/j/birthday/lunch2.jpg"></div><br>
        the best part of this lunch... its been more than a week and we're not ill! the seafood was SOOOO GOOD... there was this soft shell crab i don't have a photo of that i cannot stop thinking about. and ending a lunch with matcha ice cream is the best way to end a lunch.
        </p>
        <p><i>the mall!!!</i></p>
        <p>one thing my wife and i are going to do.... its have a mall day! the best malls are a little far from us but this adventure was well worth the trek. i hadn't been to this mall in a very very long time and it was so delightful to return. <br>
        i know that sounds crazy too! but this is such a good mall... such good stores.... hot topic and a squishables storefront lol. <strong>WE WENT OTHER PLACES!!</strong> but those were the most important ones. if you expect me to act normal in a squishables store... think again.
        <div class="image"><img src="/j/birthday/plush.jpg"></div><br>
        these are our first squishables!! i've admired their plushie designs for a long time but never had the gall to buy one for myself... <img src="/emotes/big cry.gif"> this is why my wife is the best lol. the plague doctor looks a lot like my drag persona which made me SO happy.<br>
        oh my god .... hot topic was SUCH a haul! <img src="/emotes/wildance.gif"> my favorite sanrio character is pochacco and i've struggled a lot in the past to find merch of him in america lol. but a couple good sanrio poll results later... i have been fed!<br>
        we've gotten a very small pochacco plush before that is small enough i could sew him to pants or something without much difficulty. <i>wait thats actually a super cute idea...</i> BUT WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THIS FUCING GUY.<br>
        <div class="image"><img src="/j/birthday/pochacco2.jpg"> <img src="/j/birthday/pochaccoflop.jpg"></div><br>
        <i>im insane... he's weighted and too heavy to hold up his big ass head.</i> this is the cutest fucking thing i have ever seen in my life. i can't get over him he's my new favorite stuffed animal <img src="/emotes/big cry.gif"> i am grown and i <i>fucking love plush and squishy things!</i><br>
        there was also a ... surprisingly good pochacco mug at hot topic? it comes with a lid shaped like his head. which beyond being very nice for shaky people like myself, it also actually keeps my coffee warmer for longer! that delighted me to no end.<br>
        <div class="image"><img src="/j/birthday/pochacco1.jpg"></div><br>
        big fan. big fan. the last and most important thing... the thing i have yet to mention, is so deeply up my alley its actually kind of unfair lol. isopod bag.... isopod bag.
        <div class="image"><img src="/j/birthday/bag.jpg"></div><br>
        fucking... <strong>isopod bag.</strong> it's also my favorite color and it's a <i>backpack!!!!</i> it's really small but kind of perfect for taking to the club or venues heehee. i love ISOPODS!!!! i have one tattooed on me lol and like 3 isopod tattoo designs ive commissioned from friends over the years. so silly.<br>
