            oughhhh... i have been experiencing what the girls call... <i>life</i>.... and it has not been so kind to me haha. i keep trying to focus enough to work on this website and learn new things, but it feels like every day something new and stressful has come up.<br>
            i've been working with an antipsychotic that doesn't do much for me for a while- my old psychiatrist sent me a bunch as a last kind act before i found one who actually knew what they were doing. however, psychiatrists who know what theyre doing seem to be in short supply when you experience what i do.
            to add fuel to the fire my therapist proved his uselessness. i truly wish i was just paranoid, but how do i seem to be consistently doing worse after seeing this guy for two years? i worry its my fault a lot. it allways feels like my fault.<br>
            so basically, i'm a severely mentally ill adult with no mental health team, under a national leader who seems to be fast tracking putting mentally disabled people in inevitably abusive and isolationist hospitals. cool. i could write an entire entry, maybe book, on how much it sucks to be schizophrenic under any leader in any country, but especially right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            i'm gonna be honest though, i've never done well for writing out all my complaints and frets. it tends to manifest worse things in my life. i don't know why. it hasn't all been bad, bureaucracy is bureaucracy is always bad, you know? i can count my chickens too.<br>
            i finally got my wife to start watching full metal alchemist brotherhood. and we've been playing SO much stardew valley- our appearances have actually changed so much i have to update that page a LOT now that i'm feeling a little more stable. she's playing the ps2 hajime no ippo boxing game right now and it's fun background noise. i like the cartoonish hitting sounds.<br>
            i also made new friends... love making new friends... it's so hard for me but sooo important to my wellbeing lol. i've been trying to go to events again and it's been really fun to make outfits and do makeup. i like dressing up a lot <img src="/emotes/love2.gif"><br>
            going to try and create a new color scheme for this website because i'm no longer enjoying the browns and greens. i created a really pretty gradient on my homepage i want to base it around. maybe i will make my own background now that i am getting back into drawing!
        </p>
        <p>
            i just wanted to hold myself accountable to using this and getting adapted to it, and makeing a new journal entry was a really good referesher. sorry i didn't have much interesting commentary today. juat getting back in the swing of things, haha.<br>
            thanks nekoweb for not deleting my account while i had a mental breakdown for a while.... much love to all and to all a good night
