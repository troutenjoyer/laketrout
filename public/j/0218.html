        <p>hello everyone! this is my first attempt at creating an rss feed and making it work. i like having a digital journal, it's very calming for me. so i have decided to set this up.<br>
        i am not very good at knowing what to journal about... and i am quite new to coding... so lets see how this goes...!</p>

        <p>so ... who am i?</p>
        <p>i go by trout. im 25, and i use it pronouns. i am schizophrenic and spend a lot of time inside because of this . im working on it though <img src="/trout.nekoweb.org/emotes/sweat.gif"> i am an artist, performer, and enjoyer of things.</p>
        <p><i>art:</i> i draw a lot traditionally, mostly furry art! a lot of t4t sex... and vent art. this is something i do purely for myself.</p>
        <p><i>performer:</i> i do drag in my city. for the time being i keep this somewhat separate from my online persona. i am exploring the world of digital drag though, as my ability to go outside gets harder with my disability.</p>
        <p><strong>enjoyer! of! things!</strong><br>
