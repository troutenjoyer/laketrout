		<h2>why boots?</h2>
		<p>
			every time i have gone to boots, i have felt extremely loved, accepted, and seen. their harm reductive stance on drug use, their attentiveness to partygoers fun and safety, the incredible djs they feature... boots has quickly become my home and safe space to dance every month! i don't know where i'd be without this outlet to dress up and have fun.
