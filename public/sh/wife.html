          my wife is my favorite person in the world! she's a puppigirl with catgirl undertones... kinda the sexiest combo. she works in tech and has been such a support to me over the years. being able to spend every day with her is the greatest privilege.<br>
          <strong><i>before:</i></strong> hookup to dogwalker to lovers pipeline is sooo crazy. i love that for us<br>
          <strong><i>dating:</i></strong> who knows when it started! i was supposed to ask her to be my girlfriend at a circus we went to... but the circus was really bad ! i didn't want to ask her to be my girlfriend at a bad circus... <img src="/emotes/sad.gif"> so on the car ride home we agreed we were officially lovers ♡<br>
          <strong><i>married:</strong> november 2024!</i> cishet people are dumb and bad at marriage. this has been the best era of our relationship. i am soooo infinite with love for her. it means so much to me how much she loves me and i love her. i love making dinner with her, i love driving places with her, i love having gaming and crafting and dancing days. i love justified and letterkenny and ds9 and everything we enjoy together. she is my world.<br>
          <strong><i>currently:</i></strong> in our healing era! we're both increasing how much care we get to continue to become the best versions of us for each other and our friends. also, i'm getting her into more artistic passions! that makes me so happy, she has such a creative mind and i love to see her use it.<br>
